# LIMITATIONS

- The system is not calibrated to real-world data.
  As a result, absolute magnitudes of stress or failure should not be interpreted
  as realistic thresholds, only as relative signals within the simulated system.

- The simulator is not suitable for operational decision making.
  It intentionally omits political, legal, and human factors that dominate
  real-world public system responses under crisis.

- Failure patterns produced by the simulation are illustrative, not predictive.
  They highlight coordination breakdown mechanisms, but do not forecast
  when or where such failures would occur in reality.

- Abstractions may fail in misleading ways.
  Simplified agent behaviors can create intuitively plausible but structurally
  invalid explanations if interpreted outside the defined system boundaries.

- The model systematically ignores adaptation.
  Agents do not learn, improvise, or violate protocol, which can understate
  both resilience and catastrophic collapse observed in real systems.
