# Multi-Agent Infrastructure Stress Simulator

## Problem
Public systems fail under stress not because of lack of intelligence,
but because of coordination breakdown.

## Why Simulation (Not Prediction)
We are not forecasting outcomes.
We are exploring failure modes under controlled stress.

## Status
Day-1: Core simulation skeleton.
No scenarios. No results.
