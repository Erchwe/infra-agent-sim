# LIMITATIONS

- The system is not calibrated to real-world data.
  Absolute stress values, thresholds, and failure timings should not be
  interpreted as realistic, only as relative signals within the simulated system.

- The simulator is not suitable for operational decision making.
  It intentionally omits political negotiation, legal constraints,
  and human discretion that dominate real-world public system responses.

- Failure patterns are illustrative, not predictive.
  The simulation highlights coordination breakdown mechanisms,
  not when or where such failures will occur in reality.

- Abstractions may fail in misleading ways.
  Simplified agent behaviors can produce intuitively plausible but structurally
  invalid explanations if interpreted outside the defined system boundaries.

- The model systematically ignores adaptation.
  Agents do not learn, improvise, or violate protocol, which can understate
  both resilience and catastrophic collapse observed in real systems.
